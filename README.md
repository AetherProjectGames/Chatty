# Chatty (Bukkit)

Chatty is a unique Bukkit-plugin, that supports all modern Bukkit-servers, such as Thermos, Cauldron, Spigot, PaperSpigot e t.c. This plugin doesn't have any non-switchable options. It's simple, stable and lightweight.

  - Chat-modes, such as local and global chats. Also you can add another chat-mode.
  - Permission chat-modes separation. For example, if you have permission "chatty.chat.local", but have "chatty.chat.global", your message will sent at global chat.
  - SPY-mode permission. Players with "chatty.spy" permission can see all messages from all chat-modes.
  - Vault API support.
